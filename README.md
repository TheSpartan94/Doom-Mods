# Doom Mods
Mods made mostly for fun in the world of old games using Doom Engines or derivates.

All of my works are protected and belong to me (unless specifically said otherwise). If you have any desire to use my mods, you're welcome, but please include 
in your own work credit to me if you're using any of them.

Most of these works are untouched from a long time and uncomplete. If you're interested on continuing any of them, please contact me 
and we'll discuss about the idea.
